      I love to travel and explore the world since I believe that every journey you take makes you grow and discover the person they are meant to be. I am a very positive person and although I don't mind being sarcastic and making fun of the bad luck i have once in a while, I try to always see the world with a glass half full mentality.</p>
      <p>
       Whatever I decide to do, I am enthusiastic about it as well as try my best in it. My bank account can definitely confirm that I’m very passionate about both the beauty and fashion industry. I am always up for a challenge as well as eager and willing to learn while enjoying every minute of it!!!

        If there is one thing I have to tell about myself, it is that I believe in destiny. I believe in everything around us happens for a reason. I am a very easy-going person who gets little pleasures out of everything. I love traveling without plans and exploring thousands of miles spread around the globe.</p>
        <p> I am a craft enthusiast and I have been always blessed with creativity. Being hungry for knowledge is another gift I got, and broadening my horizon with the knowledge of Ayurveda and its benefits made me realize how much we have forgotten our forefather's touch.</p>

        <p> With goal to bring back all those essential teachings we left behind throughout these years, I started helping people with the benefits of natural healing. And learning about the science behind every cultural habit opened my mind to many possibilities besides knowledge and skills. I love desserts, I am very passionate about food in general and I love sharing my passion with the world.

    <h1>Our story</h1>
    <article>

      <p>Idea of skincare and beauty products sparked in Catherina’s mind
several years backwards, as she was back in her home country, Malaysia.
Catherina’s grandmother, coming from Indian culture, taught her how to take care of her body using homemade, natural concoctions. Making these at home by herself was much harder than buying them in the grocery shop, but she realized it is worth it, when she compared the effects of these products. Cartherina’s products were helping her customers in Malaysia, but ever since she moved to Denmark, she wanted to contribute to Scandinavians with gifts of her grandmother’s culture and wisdom of natural body and health care.
